# Applications

## TIR Camera Calibration

The circular pattern offers strong detection robustness, making it especially effective for unconventional cameras such as **thermal infrared (TIR) cameras**.  
Watch the video to see it in action:

<!-- ## TIR–RGB Extrinsic Calibration

Below is the result of **stereo rectification** using RGB and TIR images.  
Both intrinsic and extrinsic calibration were performed with **DiscoCal**.  
As shown, the **epipolar lines** are perfectly aligned — despite the differences in sensor modalities.

## Underwater Environment

DiscoCal also works in challenging environments such as **underwater settings**.
