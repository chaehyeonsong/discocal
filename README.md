# DiscoCal

**DiscoCal** is a highly accurate, robust, and fast camera calibration tool. It utilizes a **circular pattern**, which offers more precise measurements compared to a checkerboard. For more details, see [Why DiscoCal?](/index/Why.md)

## Supported Tasks

DiscoCal supports the following tasks *(the list will be continuously updated)*:

- RGB camera intrinsic calibration  
- Thermal-infrared camera intrinsic calibration  
- Multi-camera extrinsic calibration  
- Camera‚ÄìLiDAR extrinsic calibration *(coming soon)*

## Project Information

This project began in **April 2024** and is actively maintained by the [RPM Robotics Lab](https://rpm.snu.ac.kr/index.php/Main/About) at **Seoul National University**, South Korea.
